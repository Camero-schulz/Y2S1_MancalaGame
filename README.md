# MANCALA GAME

## Description

Setup
 
The Mancala 'board' is made up of two rows of six holes, or pits, each. If you don't have a Mancala board handy, an empty egg carton can work. Next, four pieces -- marbles or stones -- are placed in each of the 12 holes. The color of the pieces is irrelevant.

Each player has a 'store' to the right side of the Mancala board. (Cereal bowls work well for this purpose.)

Play

KALAH RULES
The game begins with one player picking up all of the pieces in any one of the holes on his side.Moving counter-clockwise, the player deposits one of the stones in each hole until the stones run out.

1. If you run into your own store, deposit one piece in it. If you run into your opponent's store, skip it.
2. If the last piece you drop is in your own store, you get a free turn.
3. If the last piece you drop is in an empty hole on your side, you capture that piece and any pieces in the hole directly opposite.
4. Always place all captured pieces in your store.

AYO RULES
1. When sowing the seeds, the starting pit is excluded. If there are enough stones in a pit to travel around the
board without reaching the starting pit on the second pass, no stone is placed in the original starting pit. In
other words, the starting pit always remains empty after a move.

2. After distributing the stones, if the last stone lands in a pit on either side of the board that already contains
stones, all the stones in that pit are collected and redistributed. This multi-lap play continues until the last
seed falls into an empty pit, which concludes the turn unless a capture occurs.

3. A capture takes place when the last stone lands in an empty pit on the player’s side, and there are stones in
the pit directly opposite. In such a case, all of the opponent’s stones from the opposite pit are captured and
placed in the player’s store. The final stone from the player’s own side is not captured; it remains in play.
If the opposite pit has no stones, the move ends, and no stones are captured. Additionally, if the final stone
lands on the opponent’s side, no stones are captured.

Winning the game
The game ends when all six spaces on one side of the Mancala board are empty. The player who still has pieces on his side of the board when the game ends captures all of those pieces. Count all the pieces in each store. The winner is the player with the most pieces.

Tips:
Planning ahead is essential to victory in board games like Mancala. Try to plan two or three moves into the future.

- Loading players recognizes a player and loads it -- but doesn't display it
- Player information cannot be saved
- Create New Player button doesn't do anything
